            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>I am a mom to a beautiful little girl. We love to read, sing, dance, laugh play eat and pray together. As a developer, I utilize design based thinking as well as utilizing the Challenge Based Leasrning (CBL) process of development, design, coding and project management. I am a creative and thoughful developer who focuses on utilizing research to create meaningful experiences.</p>
            <p>My name is Teryn, but you can also call me Teekie. I gave myself this name when I became an auntie for the first time. I had 3 beams of light that would soon be shinning their lights into this world. I wanted a special name that would have meaning, represent how I am and what I wanted to be for "<i>my</i> babies" and what I strive to be to the world in general. </p>
            <p>I aim to share my light and help give flame to others when they're feeling dim so that our shared light can spread and continue to spread from one person to the next. You can count on me to be a "<i>Teekie</i>" torch shinning my light to leada the way in the face of adversity. </p>
            <h2>Passions</h2>
            <p> I design t-shirts, cups, event decor, and run my own company, Sweet Prints & Customs, where I have specialized in creating custom apparel helping people see their vision come to life with intentional and creative designs.</p>
            <p>I love baking and creating delicious, healthy snacks and drinks that, at first taste, make you think they might not be so healthy after all. I incorporate ingredients such as dates, fresh fruits, honey, plant based milks, nuts and seeds, coconut sugar, almond flour... I think you get the point. I try my best to use the most antioxident rich and nutricious sources of life. Eating and drinking healthy help regulate my hormones and mood so that I can be the light I desire and aim to be. </p>
            <h2>Journey</h2>
            <p>Most of my career and personal life has involved working in the community and with nonprofit organizations. I began volunteering at my church as a Children’s Church teacher 15 years ago. My personal experiences as well as stories I’ve heard have fueled my passion for positively contributing to the community and being a listening ear for anyone in need.</p>
            <p>As a  Human Resource consultant  I traveled across the U.S helping ease the transition process of Head Start programs entering or leaving leadership of a national interim management company. My role led me to assist in IS management and give valuable insight on how data management systems could work more effectively when hiring staff. </p>
            <p> From the time I was 5 months to 9 months pregnant I attended a bootcamp where I learned Full Stack web development and computer science fundamentals focusing on Qualitative Analysis. Little did I know began coding and designing back when MySpace was around as I remember writing simple code to implement my favorite songs on my profile. That interest followed my to college when one of my college classes taught code which I used to develop a blog website on hegemonic masculinity for a group project. And although that was the first time I knew for certain I was being introduced to web development, it certainly wasn't my last.</p>
            <p> I created an online magazine blog site as a result of a class project my senior year of college where I was able to combine my love of fashion, tech, art and community. I carried this on to start a business and hope to continue the mission fostering community and positive media influence. </p>
