        <p style="color:rebeccapurple;font-weight: bold;">I am a mom to a beautiful little girl. We love to read, sing, dance, laugh play eat and pray together. As a developer, I utilize design based thinking as well as utilizing the Challenge Based Leasrning (CBL) process of development, design, coding and project management. I am a creative and thoughful developer who focuses on utilizing research to create meaningful experiences.</p>
        <p>My name is Teryn, but you can also call me Teekie. I gave myself this name when I became an auntie for the first time. I had 3 beams of light that would soon be shinning their lights into this world. I wanted a special name that would have meaning, represent how I am and what I wanted to be for "<i>my</i> babies" and what I strive to be to the world in general. </p>
        <p>I aim to share my light and help give flame to others when they're feeling dim so that our shared light can spread and continue to spread from one person to the next. You can count on me to be a "<i>Teekie</i>" torch shinning my light to lead the way in the face of adversity. </p>
